Demonstrates how to simply create a web page that uses gnuplot to graph 2d functions, 3d functions, and plots of financial time series data.

Initially created as a perl cgi script.

Currently being ported to have the same functionality using haskell and cgi.

Future plans are to experiment with the HAppS and WASH haskell web frameworks to expand on existing functionality, eventually winding up with something like a pastebin for gnuplot that would display and remember scripts in such a way that they could be posted as urls, eg to forums. Code for this might be loosely based on hpaste.
